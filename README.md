Dylan Madisetti - A Personal Website
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmadisetti/dylanmadisetti.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dylanmadisetti/noughtscrosses)

Pretty basic stuff: V2.0 (on GAE at least)

Part resume, part project; I don't think there's another Dylan Madisetti out there, but also part domain squatting
